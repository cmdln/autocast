            <itunes:summary>This is news cast 222, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

In the intro, letting everyone know Dragon*Con is coming up. I'll be taking a little more time this year off from the show to prepare for my travel there. There will be no news cast on either September 29th or the 5th. There will be no feature cast on the 1st and possibly the 8th, depending on what recordings I come back with and how much work they need.

This week's security alerts are first Android SMS trojan and a vulnerability in OpenSSL 1.0.

In this week's news artificial life evolves a basic memory, John Doe who challenged the FBI freed to speak, touch screens open to smudge attack, and the state of 3D printing. The book I mention in the a-life segment is "Complexity" by Mitch Waldrop.

Following up this week just the announcement of what Google and Verizon were up to. There was an op-ed from the two CEOs though I don't think it added anything. There was also a ton of analysis and commentary though I am going to recommend that from EFF's Cindy Cohn. Not surprisingly, Google has already posted a defense.

I get why most of the coverage is so positive but I cannot help but give voice to my inner cynic.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is news cast 219, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.</p>

<p>In the intro, an admission of a mistake around correctly observing the licenses of some works I used after I stopped using the non-commercial clause in the license for the podcast. The net effect should be none to you, the listener, but it seemed like a good teaching moment and a reminder that as easy as Creative Commons makes it to understand their licenses, that doesn't prevent making honest mistakes. Thanks, Randal.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a feature cast, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.</p>

<p>Listener feedback this week is from quite a few folks. Matt wrote in about outliners, asking what I do in particular to bend vim to this task. I use a vimrc line like "autocmd BufEnter,BufNew *.notes set sw=4 ts=4 expandtab spell tw=0 foldmethod=indent smartindent". Colin posted a <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2010/06/23/linux_switch/#comment-5828">comment</a> about AAC and chapter marks. John had a much more incisive comment on my switching to an open stack segment. Ian also wrote about outliners, suggesting <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> and in particular a <a href="http://orgmode.org/talks/index.html#sec-2">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.nf.mpg.de/orgmode/guest-talk-dominik.html">screencasts</a>. And Max shared his experiences switching to Linux not once, but twice.</p>

<p>The hacker word of the week this week is <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/filter.html">filter</a>.</p>

<p>The feature this week is a rant digging into the question of whether we'll ever develop effective controls that match our complex expectations of privacy and digging into the source of that complexity. I mention <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/14/facebook-and-radical-transparency-a-rant.html">a couple</a> <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/15/facebook-is-a-utility-utilities-get-regulated.html">of posts</a> by danah boyd, some <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/18/facebook_hoofnagle_podcast/">criticism</a> of the demands made of Facebook by privacy advocates, my reading of Clay Shirky's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114948?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecommandl0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143114948">Here Comes Everybody</a>", and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">small world networks</a>.</p>

<p>I will save this week's feedback, of which there is rather a lot, until next week.</p>

            <itunes:summary>This is news cast 217, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

In the intro, an apology for missing the last news cast.

This week's security alerts are attacking the attackers and anti-malware is a poor substitute for common sense.

In this week's news NY meet Silicon Valley, the first report from the new IP enforcement czar and some analysis and some reactions, looking at HTML5 beyond video, and an explanation why Share Alike is open and Non Commercial is not.

Following up this week, the debate around C-32 turns adversarial and judge rules in Viacom case that YouTube is protected by DMCA safe harbors.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a feature cast, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.</p>

<p>In the intro, thanks to Paul, Steve and Ryan for their new monthly donations starting this week. Badges are on their way or should be soon.  I also remark on my upcoming 5th anniversary as a podcaster for those that don't read the blog.</p>

<p>Listener feedback this week is from Jed in response to the Inner Chapter on why programming is hard. I mention the <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2010/06/13/news_216/">news cast</a> from the 13th, the piece Bruce Sterling mentions about smart-aleck programmers by Jonathan Edwards.</p>

<p>The hacker word of the week this week is <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/fence.html">fence</a>.</p>

<p>The feature this week is a monologue discussing my decision to move back to an open stack here in the lab. I mention Dan Gillmor's <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/06/20/from_mac_to_linux/index.html">Salon article</a> discussing the very same thing and my <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2009/11/18/nowhere_to_go/">Nowhere to Go</a> rant.</p>

In the intro, just a pointer to my thoughts on Balticon 44 and a recap on advertising, the badge experiment, and Flattr so far.

This week's security alerts are OS choice does not equal security and an Android rootkit.

In this week's news Google drops Microsoft for internal use citing security reasons though some are skeptical, figuring out if Wikileaks spun up using documents intercepted from Tor with thoughts from both the Tor project and Wikileaks itself, IBM's 40 year old Muppet sales films, and a new paper debunks certain suggested advantages of quantum computing.

Following up this week, if you are tired of Facebook then check out a Firefox extension that aims to help preserve your privacy while using it and India tries to gather opposition to ACTA.

            <itunes:summary>This is news cast 213, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

In the intro, thanks to new monthly donor, Jamie. Also, I was interviewed for Uber Leet Hacker Force Radio, part of Hacker Public Radio. My part starts around minute twenty-three. Lastly, I will be interviewing Cory Doctorow about his latest YA novel, "For the Win". I'm scheduled to do so on Thursday, the 13th, so if you have any questions for him, get them to me before then.

This week's security alerts are a new attack technique that bypasses most common antivirus programs demonstrated by matousec.com and study that shows programming language choice doesn't affect security.

In this week's news Hugo Gernsback as futurist (I've read more about him as a publisher) including some criticism of his views of the place of science in science fiction, why computers crash but biology does not, a rallying cry for parallelism even though the trend is well established and the challenges hard then first supposed, and Google releases a code lab and sources to teach and learn security through reading code and hands on exercises.

Following up this week the FCC's third way to pursue network neutrality and the FCC allows selectable output control with some qualifications.

            <itunes:summary>This is news cast 211, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

In the intro, thanks to new donor this week, David.

This week's security alerts are a new site collecting privacy and security info on apps and services and a vulnerability in WebKit's handling of the blink tag.

In this week's news reverse engineering facial recognition to develop dazzle camouflage (a story I also wrote up on the web site), asking whether IBM broke its open source patent pledge with their response and clarifying commentary from a couple of knowledgeable folks, a new memory management technique that could boost performance for multiple cores, and contending format shifting a book you own is ethical with supporting and dissenting responses.

Following up this week court rules against FCC in Comcast case barring neutrality regulation on ancillary authority but not through other means and the Digital Economy Bill has been passed including what we should do now.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a feature cast, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.</p>

<p>In the intro, a correction on the rant (I recorded it previously) based on further explanation by Cory in the <a href="http://craphound.com/?p=2736">Lab Out Loud interview</a> about price discrimination and demand elasticity. Also, <a href="http://findingada.com">Happy Ada Lovelace Day</a>. As pledged, I've written a <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2010/03/24/ada-lovelace-day-2010/">blog post</a> for the day.

(Although big content is starting to <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2010/03/18/ip-terrorism-rhetoric-takes-a-new-turn/">agree</a> though for very different reasons.) Mostly this is in response to Ars Technica's <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2010/03/08/is-ad-blocking-choking-sites-to-death/">ad blocking experiment</a>, in particular my friend Nuri's thoughts on that story.

<p>The feature this week is an interview with cartoonist and animator, <a href="http://ninapaley.com">Nina Paley</a>, creator of "<a href="http://sitasingstheblues.com">Sita Sings the Blues</a>". I've spoken and written about Nina's story before, <a href="http://questioncopyright.org/sita_distribution">the troubles</a> clearing her use of Annette Hanshaw's torch songs that led her to work with Karl Fogel at <a href="http://questioncopyright.org">QuestionCopyright.org</a>.

            <itunes:summary>This is a feature cast, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

No listener feedback this week.

Due to the length of the interview, there is also no new hacker word of the week this week.

The feature this week is an interview with cartoonist and animator, Nina Paley, creator of "Sita Sings the Blues". I've spoken and written about Nina's story before, the troubles clearing her use of Annette Hanshaw's torch songs that led her to work with Karl Fogel at QuestionCopyright.org. In the course of the interview, we also mention the store for "Sita" merchandise , the creator endorsed mark, "Minute Memes", the "Sita" soundtrack by Todd Michaelsen, "Sita" on a persistence of vision wheel based display, and Bill Cheswick's poster made from every frame of "Sita". Sadly, by the time you hear this, you'll have missed her talk at AU but I discuss it a bit in the intro to this episode.

This week's security alerts are details on an exploitable flaw in older versions of MSIE including news of an actual exploit and the latest iPhone worm snags bank credentials.

In this week's news research suggesting combining the promising techniques in quantum computing to produce a viable system sooner (this builds on recent work by NIST and a design for a photon "machine gun" for producing larger registers of qubits), encoding shell code as English text, a client side file handling API for JavaScript and HTML5 which is already implemented in Firefox's latest beta build, and a site for sharing information about rejections for Apple's app store.

Following up this week evaluating privacy in the revised Books settlement and two senators question ACTA secrecy.

There almost definitely will be a feature show next week since I should have my interview with Cory to release. Also a revelation, that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1018887/">"Dreams with Sharp Teeth"</a> has convinced me I am not much of a curmudgeon.</p>

<p>The feature this week is an interview with <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/">Randal Schwartz</a>. I first met Randal through his talk on his experience being snared under one of the problematic computer fraud and abuse laws. We don't discuss that topic in the interview but if you are curious, he recommends <a href="http://www.securitycatalyst.com/security-catalyst-26-insider-interviews-randal-schwartz/">his appearance on the Security Catalyst podcast</a> and <a href="http://www.thefutureandyou.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=329133">his interview with Stephen Euin Cobb on the Future and You</a>. Randal also mentions the <a href="http://squeakbyexample.org/">Squeak by Example</a> book in the interview which is available as a free electronic edition and a print-on-demand edition. You can also hear Randal on the excellent <a href="http://twit.tv/FLOSS">FLOSS Weekly</a> podcast which I also recommend for its consistently superb coverage of free software and open source projects of all varieties.</p>

<p>In the intro, a correction from Randal on the correct pronunciation of "Kernighan". Also, Gail Martin interviewed me for her podcast, <a href="http://www.ghostinthemachinepodcast.com/">Ghost in the Machine</a>. We chatted about peer media, open content and media advocacy. You can <a href="http://ghostinthemachinepodcast.com/?p=98">download the interview</a> or <a href="http://gzmartin.audioacrobat.com/rss/gailzmartinpodcast.xml">subscribe to her feed</a>, she interviews many other fascinating, aspiring authors on her show.</p>

<p>I'm going to push off on listener feedback until next week. Also, no hacker word of the week for the same reason, the length of the feature.</p>

<p>The feature this week is the recording of the "Creative Commons and Legal Issues" panel from the podcasting track at <a href="http://dragoncon.org/">Dragon*Con 2009</a>, otherwise known simply as the copyright panel. I was joined by Thomas Vincent, Randy Chertkow of <a href="http://beatnikturtle.com/">Beatnik Turtle</a>, and Courtney Lytle Perry. This is the third time Randy and Courtney have joined me for this panel and it was a sheer pleasure. The audio is a little over driven, we were having speaker issues this year, but I think I managed to get things a bit under control.</p>

<p>In the intro, a request that you consider making a sustaining donation to your favorite free software project or open content producer, whether or not that happens to be me. The thought was inspired by my finally adding a recurring donation button to my web site.</p>

<p>Also, a clarification in case there was any confusion.

In the intro, a request that you consider making a sustaining donation to your favorite free software project or open content producer, whether or not that happens to be me. The thought was inspired by my finally adding a recurring donation button to my web site.

Also, a clarification in case there was any confusion. My talk for the local Software Freedom Day is at 11:30, the event starts at 10:30 in the computer lab at the Miller Branch of the Howard County Library. The schedule of talks is now available online.

Listener feedback this week (catching up) comes from Paul Fischer who writes in response to the August 23rd show, specifically to the stories about Menuet and cracking the SecurID token.

The hacker word of the week this week is ENQ.

The feature this week is a Hacking 101 on the subject of Golden Hammer Syndrome, something all beginning hackers need to beware of.
