This project is a collection of simple scripts used to help automate various tasks involved in the production of The Command Line Podcast.

append.py - Compares the podcast category feed for the podcast's web site with format specific feeds, adding the newest episode if missing.
encode.bash - Drives a set of encoders and tagging utilities to convert a single WAV input file into flac, Ogg Vorbis, AAC and MP3 files with complete and consistent metadata.
relink.py - A script intended for one time use to tweak a feed to re-link its enclosures to appropriate URLs at the Internet Archive.
tidyrc - Tidy config that approximates the formatting of the live feeds to minimize disruption.
publish.bash - Script to automate as much of the publishing step as possible.
with_offset.xsl - Transform that handles the recursive structure of OmniOutliner files better than Beautiful Soup does, works with completed show notes that have time offsets.
without_offset.xsl - Transform that handles the recursive structure of OmniOutliner files better than Beautiful Soup does, works with segment notes that do not have time offsets.
outline.bash - Drives the XSLT operation and subsequent scripting tasks that cannot be handled in XSL.
cleanup.bash - Remove output files produced from encode.bash
restore.bash - Restore backup of feed files made today on top of current feed files.
