		<itunes:summary>This is news cast 223, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

In the intro, an obligatory reminder there will be no new shows on the 29th, the 1st and the 5th because of Dragon*Con. Also, if you are in the north west of the UK, check out U^3 an UnWorkShop being held the 28th of August.

This week's security alerts are a Firefox bug bypasses URL protection for embedded frames and an old Linux Kernel flaw allows exploits to acquire root privileges.

In this week's news the end of privacy, a new probabilistic processor design, a thirty year old crypto system is resistant to quantum cryptanalysis, and privacy concerns (among others) over Facebook's new Places feature. The EFF already has a guide to protecting your privacy against it.

Following up this week EFF appealing the Jewel v. NSA warrantless wiretapping case and negotiators concede ACTA isn't about counterfeiting after all.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is news cast 222, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.</p>
<p>In the intro, letting everyone know <a href="http://dragoncon.org/">Dragon*Con</a> is coming up. I&#8217;ll be taking a little more time this year off from the show to prepare for my travel there. There will be no news cast on either September 29th or the 5th. There will be no feature cast on the 1st and possibly the 8th, depending on what recordings I come back with and how much work they need.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s security alerts are <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2010/08/10/242321/android-phones-hit-by-text-based-trojan.htm">first Android SMS trojan</a> and <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Vulnerability-in-OpenSSL-1-0-x-1053147.html">a vulnerability in OpenSSL 1.0</a>.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s news <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/08/08/0110222/Artificial-Life-Forms-Evolve-Basic-Memory-Strategy">artificial life evolves a basic memory</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/08/nsl-gag-order-lifted/">John Doe who challenged the FBI freed to speak</a>, <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/08/11/128244/Touchscreens-Open-To-Smudge-Attacks">touch screens open to smudge attack</a>, and <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2010/08/09/scott-summit-on-the-future-of-3d-printing/">the state of 3D printing</a>. The book I mention in the a-life segment is &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671872346?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecommandl0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0671872346">Complexity</a>&#8221; by Mitch Waldrop.</p>
<p>Following up this week <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/08/joint-policy-proposal-for-open-internet.html">just the announcement of what Google and Verizon were up to</a>. There was an <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/08/google-and-verizon-op-ed-path-to-open.html">op-ed from the two CEOs</a> though I don&#8217;t think it added anything. There was also a ton of analysis and commentary though I am going to recommend that from <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/08/google-verizon-netneutrality">EFF&#8217;s Cindy Cohn</a>. Not surprisingly, Google has already posted a <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/08/facts-about-our-network-neutrality.html">defense</a>.</p>

		<itunes:summary>This is news cast 221, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

In the intro, my thanks to Mike for his donation for which he has earned a merit badge. A final reminder there will not be a feature cast this coming week, I'll be out in San Francisco for most of the week. Also, a quick review of George Mann's "The Osiris Ritual". I reviewed his first novel, "The Affinity Bridge", earlier in the Summer.

This week's security alerts are RFIDs can be provably read at over 60 meters and an algorithmic attack on reCAPTCHA.

In this week's news an algorithm to improve the energy efficiency of mesh networks, concerns over a citizen vigilante group monitor ISPs though the groups claims may be overstated, Google ends Wave development though is dedicated to learning from its failure in this case probably from its complexity despite adding more resources and opening up to more users, and unpacking what exactly went on between Google and Verizon especially as they deny claims of an anti-neutrality pact (even on Twitter). Odds are good they are still meeting and talking to some end which may be why the NYT is sticking to its story. Cringely has the most intriguing guess at their possible goal.

Following up this week EFF offers assistance to targets of the US Copyright Group and the FCC ends closed door discussions on its net neutrality plan.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is news cast 220, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.</p>
<p>In the intro, an apology for missing the last two shows, though I had <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2010/07/28/power-restored/">good reason</a>. I will be <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2010/07/30/ill-be-in-san-francisco-aug-9th-through-11th-for-cassandra-summit-2010/">in San Francisco from August 9th to the 11th</a> for Cassandra Summit and a training day. If anyone is interested in a meet up Monday or Tuesday night, let me know. And if you don&#8217;t read the web site, I am a <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2010/07/29/parsec-finalist/">finalist for a Parsec award</a>.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s security alerts are <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/apple-patches-safari-auto-fill-security-hole/6991">Apple fixes the autofill bug in Safari</a> that I didn&#8217;t get to discuss <a href="http://thecommandline.net/wiki/2010_07_25#alert1">last week</a> and <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/story/10/07/28/2210217/ATampT-Wont-Block-Black-Hat-Eavesdropping-Demo">AT&amp;T said it wouldn&#8217;t interfere with a Black Hat demo</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/intercepting-cell-phone-calls/">was true to its word</a>.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s news <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/intercepting-cell-phone-calls/">EFF wins three DMCA exemptions</a> with deeper analysis from both <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/07/breaking-down-2009-dmca-rulemaking-part-1-victory">them</a> and <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/blog/library-congresss-drm-exceptions-not-just-abo">Public Knowledge</a>.

I get why most of the coverage is so <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/fair_use_not_just_acceptable_its_essential_for_the.php">positive</a> but I cannot help but give voice to my inner cynic. Also, the <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/07/sen_kerry_to_introduce_interne.html?wprss=posttech">Senate prepares privacy legislation</a> as <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/07/senate_online_privacy_hearing.html?wprss=posttech">industry discusses self regulation</a>, a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/e-readers_help_literacy_in_ghana.php">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/07/humane-wikipedia-reader/">stories</a> about e-books in developing nations, and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/slashdot_struggles_to_remain_relevant_in_the_socia.php">Slashdot is losing relevance on the social web</a>.</p>

		<itunes:summary>This is news cast 220, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

In the intro, an apology for missing the last two shows, though I had good reason. I will be in San Francisco from August 9th to the 11th for Cassandra Summit and a training day. If anyone is interested in a meet up Monday or Tuesday night, let me know. And if you don't read the web site, I am a finalist for a Parsec award.

This week's security alerts are Apple fixes the autofill bug in Safari that I didn't get to discuss last week and AT&#38;T said it wouldn't interfere with a Black Hat demo and was true to its word.

In this week's news EFF wins three DMCA exemptions with deeper analysis from both them and Public Knowledge. There were two additional exemptions granted and many others that were not. I get why most of the coverage is so positive but I cannot help but give voice to my inner cynic. Also, the Senate prepares privacy legislation as industry discusses self regulation, a couple of stories about e-books in developing nations, and Slashdot is losing relevance on the social web.

Following up this week Al Franken frames net neutrality as key free speech issue and Canadian C-32 is clearly following the US DMCA.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is news cast 219, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.</p>
<p>In the intro, an admission of a mistake around correctly observing the licenses of some works I used after I stopped using the non-commercial clause in the license for the podcast. The net effect should be none to you, the listener, but it seemed like a good teaching moment and a reminder that as easy as Creative Commons makes it to understand their licenses, that doesn&#8217;t prevent making honest mistakes. Thanks, Randal.</p>

In the intro, an admission of a mistake around correctly observing the licenses of some works I used after I stopped using the non-commercial clause in the license for the podcast. The net effect should be none to you, the listener, but it seemed like a good teaching moment and a reminder that as easy as Creative Commons makes it to understand their licenses, that doesn't prevent making honest mistakes. Thanks, Randal.

This week's security alerts are Mozilla blocking an add on that was nabbing passwords (via ZDNet) including how the backdoor was discovered and a crack that could affect libraries used to implement OAuth and OpenID.

In this week's news Android App Inventor, in keeping with Google's spirit of developer inclusion vs. Apple's puzzling decisions, promises creating apps without coding though some interesting questions remain, a comic book on digital civil rights in Europe produce by EDRi among others that I think would be a good companion to Cory Doctorow's "Little Brother", NSA whistle blower exhausted all official channels to raise a complaint, and consider the question of search neutrality and whether co-opting the rhetoric of net neutrality is wise.

Following up this week European ACTA negotiators update the EP in secret and ACTA is coming down to a fight between the US and the EU.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a feature cast, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.</p>
<p>Listener feedback this week is from quite a few folks. Matt wrote in about outliners, asking what I do in particular to bend vim to this task. I use a vimrc line like &#8220;autocmd BufEnter,BufNew *.notes set sw=4 ts=4 expandtab spell tw=0 foldmethod=indent smartindent&#8221;. Colin posted a <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2010/06/23/linux_switch/#comment-5828">comment</a> about AAC and chapter marks. John had a much more incisive comment on my switching to an open stack segment. Ian also wrote about outliners, suggesting <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> and in particular a <a href="http://orgmode.org/talks/index.html#sec-2">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.nf.mpg.de/orgmode/guest-talk-dominik.html">screencasts</a>. And Max shared his experiences switching to Linux not once, but twice.</p>
<p>The hacker word of the week this week is <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/filter.html">filter</a>.</p>
<p>The feature this week is a rant digging into the question of whether we&#8217;ll ever develop effective controls that match our complex expectations of privacy and digging into the source of that complexity. I mention <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/14/facebook-and-radical-transparency-a-rant.html">a couple</a> <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/15/facebook-is-a-utility-utilities-get-regulated.html">of posts</a> by danah boyd, some <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/18/facebook_hoofnagle_podcast/">criticism</a> of the demands made of Facebook by privacy advocates, my reading of Clay Shirky&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114948?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thecommandl0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143114948">Here Comes Everybody</a>&#8220;, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">small world networks</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a feature cast, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.</p>
<p>In the intro, thanks to my friend <a href="http://intotheblender.com/">Chooch</a> for saving my bacon with the event audio I am sharing as this week&#8217;s feature. Also, with regards to the show&#8217;s 5th anniversary, I realize I pretty much said my peace on the subject last week. Just trying to keep that spirit of being receptive to surprise alive going forward.</p>
<p>I will save this week&#8217;s feedback, of which there is rather a lot, until next week.</p>
<p>There is no hacker word of the week this week.</p>
<p>The feature this week is a recording of the talk Cory Doctorow gave at this month&#8217;s CopyNight, here in DC.</p>

		<itunes:summary>This is a feature cast, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

In the intro, thanks to my friend Chooch for saving my bacon with the event audio I am sharing as this week's feature. Also, with regards to the show's 5th anniversary, I realize I pretty much said my peace on the subject last week. Just trying to keep that spirit of being receptive to surprise alive going forward.

I will save this week's feedback, of which there is rather a lot, until next week.

There is no hacker word of the week this week.

The feature this week is a recording of the talk Cory Doctorow gave at this month's CopyNight, here in DC.



There are no detailed show notes for this episode. You can grab the flac encoded audio from the Internet Archive.

		<itunes:summary>This is news cast 217, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

In the intro, an apology for missing the last news cast.

This week's security alerts are attacking the attackers and anti-malware is a poor substitute for common sense.

In this week's news NY meet Silicon Valley, the first report from the new IP enforcement czar and some analysis and some reactions, looking at HTML5 beyond video, and an explanation why Share Alike is open and Non Commercial is not.

Following up this week, the debate around C-32 turns adversarial and judge rules in Viacom case that YouTube is protected by DMCA safe harbors.

<p>In the intro, thanks to Paul, Steve and Ryan for their new monthly donations starting this week. Badges are on their way or should be soon.  I also remark on my upcoming 5th anniversary as a podcaster for those that don&#8217;t read the blog.</p>
<p>Listener feedback this week is from Jed in response to the Inner Chapter on why programming is hard. I mention the <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2010/06/13/news_216/">news cast</a> from the 13th, the piece Bruce Sterling mentions about smart-aleck programmers by Jonathan Edwards.</p>
<p>The hacker word of the week this week is <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/fence.html">fence</a>.</p>
<p>The feature this week is a monologue discussing my decision to move back to an open stack here in the lab. I mention Dan Gillmor&#8217;s <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/06/20/from_mac_to_linux/index.html">Salon article</a> discussing the very same thing and my <a href="http://thecommandline.net/2009/11/18/nowhere_to_go/">Nowhere to Go</a> rant.</p>

In the intro, an update on the badge experiment.

This week's security alerts are diffusing botnet control makes them more robust and bad passwords and the economics around perpetuating them.

In this week's news open source could make attackers' jobs easier, understanding the real risks of Android fragmentation, programmers should stop being smart-alecks, and heated atomic force microscopes for 12nm graphene elements.

Following up this week, another social network bill of rights and judge may dismiss most defendants from US Copyright Group suits.

<p>I will save listener feedback for the next show.</p>
<p>There is no hacker word of the week this week due to the length of the feature.</p>
<p>The feature this week is the second of two panel recordings I captured at <a href="http://balticon.org/">Balticon 44</a>. The panel was titled, &#8220;Free Yourself: Open Source Software for Everyday Use&#8221;. My co-panelists were <a href="http://secondshiftpodcast.com/wiki/index.php?title=Brad_Smith">Brad Smith</a> and none other than Eric Raymond. I found ESR to be especially fascinating on this panel, with some thought provoking ideas and fun stories.</p>

In the intro, just a pointer to my thoughts on Balticon 44 and a recap on advertising, the badge experiment, and Flattr so far.

This week's security alerts are OS choice does not equal security and an Android rootkit.

In this week's news Google drops Microsoft for internal use citing security reasons though some are skeptical, figuring out if Wikileaks spun up using documents intercepted from Tor with thoughts from both the Tor project and Wikileaks itself, IBM's 40 year old Muppet sales films, and a new paper debunks certain suggested advantages of quantum computing.

Following up this week, if you are tired of Facebook then check out a Firefox extension that aims to help preserve your privacy while using it and India tries to gather opposition to ACTA.

<p>The feature this week is the first of two panel recordings I captured at <a href="http://balticon.org/">Balticon 44</a>.

I will save listener feedback for the next show or the one after that.

There is no listener feedback this week due to the length of the feature.

The feature this week is the first of two panel recordings I captured at Balticon 44.

		<itunes:summary>This is a feature cast, an episode of The Command Line Podcast.

In the intro, a few quick announcements. I will be at Balticon Memorial Day weekend and posting my speaking schedule soon. If you are going to be there, come and say, "Hi". May's CopyNight will be next Tuesday, the 25th, with special guest Carl Malamud. Next month's CopyNight will also have a special guest, Cory Doctorow as it happens. That CopyNight will be June 28th, a Monday. For more details about the DC CopyNight, visit the web site.

Due to the length of the interview, I didn't get to any listener feedback this week. There also is no new hacker word of the week for the same reason.

The feature this week is an interview with Cory Doctorow discussing the issues explored in his latest book just released from Tor, "For the Win". I caught up with him over Skype on his current book tour. We mention quite a bit of material, roughly in chronological order:

	"Amerika"
	"English as She Is Spoken"
	Anda's Game
	Beyond Circumvention, by Ethan Zuckerman
	How to Stop Worrying and Love the Internet, by Douglas Adams
	It was Michael Weinberg, from Public Knowledge, on This Week in Law who proposed thinking about three strikes with the telephone
	"Content" is the essay collection containing World of Democracycraft
	Facebook is a Utility, All Utilities are Regulated, by Danah Boyd
	Diaspora*, Kickstarter, and Quit Facebook Day
	Jane McGonigal created Superstruct and the other game I couldn't remember properly is Evoke
	Alice commissioned the award winning game, Smokescreen
	Power Punctuation! in three parts: part 1, part 2, part 3
	The Geertz mentioned is anthropologist, Clifford Geertz
	io9 scooped me and has more details on "Rapture of the Nerds"

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long time listeners and readers know I am a huge fan of Cory Doctorow&#8217;s writings, both fiction and non-fiction. I am thrilled that his latest novel, &#8220;<a href="http://craphound.com/ftw/">For the Win</a>&#8220;, is out today. I was lucky enough to get an advanced reader copy and can definitely recommend the book highly for those that enjoyed Cory&#8217;s previous young adult novel, &#8220;<a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/">Little Brother</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I would say without hesitation that I enjoyed &#8220;For the Win&#8221; even more than &#8220;Little Brother&#8221;. I dug the ideas explored in the book more than I expected&#8211;organizing labor, virtual economies, the effects of online games on globalization and youth culture. The dialectic is very well woven into the stories of all the characters, you rarely if ever feel like you are receiving an info dump. The only thing I suspect some people may not like, depending on their tastes, is that the narrative is shared across the points of view of several characters. I don&#8217;t mind that, personally, but I have friends who do. For the younger readers, there is a bit of violence but it isn&#8217;t gratuitous and should be fine for teen aged readers.</p>
<p>I read my copy during the big blizzard earlier this year, when we had no power for a few days and no heat. It thoroughly kept my mind off of a very worrying situation and held up to non-stop reading over the course of a few days. Not many books would have held my interest well enough to read pretty much continuously like that, &#8220;For the Win&#8221; definitely did.</p>
<p>Of course, as with all of Cory&#8217;s books, you can <a href="http://craphound.com/ftw/download/">download</a> a free electronic copy of the book, in a number of formats, and see for yourself if you enjoy it enough to pick up a print edition. I love that this time out he included my favorite format, ePub. That format is a fan conversion and is made possible by the liberal license Cory uses. You can remix or convert the book any which way you like as long as you share your changes and don&#8217;t charge for the end result.</p>
<p>As with &#8220;Little Brother&#8221;, Cory is working with educators and librarians to get this book into the hands of kids. There are more details on how you can help with that effort at the book&#8217;s <a href="http://craphound.com/ftw/">web site</a>. You&#8217;ll also find a link to <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/Tour.aspx?id=554&amp;publisher=macmillansite">the book tour</a> that is kicking off this week. I encourage you to go out and see Cory if he&#8217;s coming to your town. He&#8217;s a dynamic and engaging speaker and reader plus you can pick up a signed copy of the book if you are a fan.</p>
<p>Lastly, I will be interviewing Cory while he&#8217;s on the book tour specifically to dig into various aspects of the book and the tropes he explores in it. If you have a relevant question you&#8217;d like me to pose, send it to me before Thursday the 13th and I&#8217;ll include as many of your questions as time allows. That interview should go out next week, Wednesday the 19th.</p>
